phpBB Garage

As poyntesm has not updated phpBB Garage in four years, I have decide to clone his repository in an effort to update the code to phpBB 3.0.11 and beyond...
All outstanding issued will be addressed and fixed...

I realise there are other clones, however this clone will endeavour to support integration into any portal written for phpbb3 with specific emphasis on the Kiss Portal Engine...


Unlike other forks, this fork will maintain the authors original copyright...


**[Note re forks and copyright]**

I have noticed in some forks the original authors copyright has been removed/replaced... this is quite simply illegal and an breach of the copyright laws...
If you have inadvertently done this, please replace the original copyright and append yours... Forking does not give to the right to remove copyright, so don't do so....
