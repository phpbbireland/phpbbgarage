phpBB Garage

As poyntesm has not updated phpBB Garage in four years, I have decide to clone his repository in an effort to update the code to phpBB 3.0.11 and beyond...
All outstanding issued will be addressed and fixed...

I realise there are other clones, however this clone will endeavour to support integration into any portal written for phpbb3 with specific emphasis on the Kiss Portal Engine...


Unlike other forks, this fork will maintain the authors original copyright...


**Note re forks and copyright:**  

Forking does not give to the right to remove copyright, so don't do so....
If you have inadvertently done this, please replace the original copyright and append yours...

**Changes:**
Moved files into a garage folder...
All garage php files are now in... root/garage ...
All style files are now in... root/styles/prosilver/template/garage ...

Install updated to phpBB 3.0.11...  
Fixed a considerable amount of coding standards issues in all files...  
Fixed all know issues with the mod, it's working 100%...  
Reduced sql variable name length to avoid a potential problem with installation...  

Note, I do not have the time to commit every individual edits so apologies for block commits...
Mike
